The ACLED dataset on Asia is used to locate drug-related incidents in several countries on the continent via leaflet and the folium module in python.\
By clicking on the app markers, an incident description will pop up. Planned extensions are the color-coding of the markers for the severity of the incident measured by fatalities.\
The project is considered as a private interest of mine.
